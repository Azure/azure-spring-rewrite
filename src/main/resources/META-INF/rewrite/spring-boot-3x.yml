displayName: Migrate to Spring Boot 3.0 from Spring Boot 1.5 through 2.6
description: >
  Migrate applications built on previous versions of Spring Boot (versions 1.5 though 2.7) to the latest Spring Boot
  3.0 release. This recipe will modify an application's build files, make changes to deprecated/preferred APIs, and
  migrate configuration settings that have changes across Spring Boot versions. This recipe will also chain additional
  framework migrations (Spring Framework, Spring Data, JUnit, etc) that are required as part of the migration to
  Spring Boot 3.0.
